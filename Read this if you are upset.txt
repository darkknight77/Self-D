Hey Bucky, You are going to be fine. Listen to me, you lived all this life happily even though there were lot of obstacles in the way. You faced them and got through all of them. You are incredibly gifted and talented. You know this fucking sadness is going to end one day or today itself. Just trust your instincts and keep your head high, nothing is gonna break you. Take conscious efforts or decisions to make everything right. 

Whatever thats bugging you is going to end sooner or later. You hold on. There are lot of other people who have gone through shit more than you did. Lot of them still got through it and are living. It's not that they forgot everything, its just that they learned to live with it. Just grow some balls and move forward in life. I believe you. Trust me, i believe you, even when the whole world is against you. Tommorow will be better, just do not give up.
