1.What is a class?
2.What is an object?
3.What are access modifiers?
4.What is static keyword?
5.What is a static block?


1a) A class is defined as userdefined template from which objects are created. It represents a set of properties or methods of an object.       
A class can also be defined as template 

2a) Object is an instance of a class. Objects have a state and behavior.

3a) Java provides access control through public, protected and private keywords. If none of these keywords are used it is called default access modifier. 

* If a variable or method is declared as private, it can be accessed only within the same class.
* If a variable or method is declared as protected, it can be accessed only within the same package or a subclass of a class in another package.
* If a variable or method is declared as default, it can be accessed within the same package only.
* If a variable or method is declared as public, it can be accessed from anywhere within a application.

4a) Static keyword is used for class level variables to make them global i.e., all the objects will share the same value.
Static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables. A static method can invoke only static methods.  
 
5a) Static blocks are used to initialize static variables. Static blocks gets executed when the class is loaded into the memory. There can be multiple static blocks in a class and they get executed in the sequence they are written in the program.
