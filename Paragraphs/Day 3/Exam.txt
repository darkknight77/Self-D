During the first part of your life, you only become aware of happiness once you have lost it. Then an age comes, a second one, in which you already know,(at the moment,) when you begin to experience true happiness, that you are, at the end of the day going to lose it. When i met Belle(,) i understood that i had just entered this (second) age. I also understood that I hadn't reached the third age, in which {the} anticipation of loss of happiness prevents you from living.




In the hospital{'s} mens room, as I'm washing my hands, I glance in the mirror. The man I see is not so much me as my father. When did he show up? There is no soap; I rub hand sanitizer into my face-it burns. I nearly drown myself in the sink trying to rinse it off. 

My face is dripping, my shirt (is) wet, and the paper-towel dispenser is empty. Waiting to dry, I carve Jane's name into the cinder-block wall with the car key.

A hospital worker almost catches me, but i head him off with a confrontation:"Why no paper towels?" 

"We don't use them anymore-sustainability"

"But my face is wet".

"Try toilet-paper".

I do-and it catches in the stubble of unshaven beard{,} and i look like i have been out in a toilet-paper snowstorm.
