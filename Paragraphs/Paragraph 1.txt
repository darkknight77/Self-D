During the first part of your life, you only become aware of true happiness once you have lost it. Then comes another age, a second one, in which you already know, at the moment when you begin to experience true happiness, that you are, at the end of the day going to lose it. When i first met Belle, i understood i have entered the second age. I also understood that i hadn't reached the third age in which the anticiation of the loss of happiness prevents you from living.
